<h2 id="about">About Zombie Chickens</h2>
<p>Zombie Chickens, the online chicken slaying phenomenon, started life as an XBOX game in mid-2010. On the night of the 7th May 2011, design genius Owen Williams, programming master Ben Selby and web guru George Cave came together for a blue bolt fuelled night of creativity to bring the game to the web.</p>
